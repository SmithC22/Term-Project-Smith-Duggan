**Battle Ship Game**

# What?
Battleship is a bord game that consists of two players placing pieces on a grid board and taking turns guessing where the other player placed their pieces. Once one guesses where all the other players pieces were place that player wins the game

# Why?
We both enjoy the game and think it will be a cool exercise to both code the actual game itself and make it so players can play with one another online.

# How?
Java has a plugin called javaFX that will allow us to create a game board and create a UI for the game, and we also will be able to code the player to player connection in java.

# Deliverables
A server that will run the game and send information to the client
* a client that will connect to the server
* a working version of a battleship game
* (if there is enough time we will make the game board in javafx, if there isn't
* we will print the game board to the cosole.)
* the demo will show the client server connection
* the demo will show the game being run by the server and having it sent to the client


# Time Table
* 11/2 Figure out how to connect two computers in java
* 11/9 have a rough prototype of the game board UI
* 11/16 start implementing the game rules
* 11/23 take user input from other computer and use it in the game
* 11/30 Improve the gameboard and connect the game to the UI
* 12/7 Hopefully have a finished product

# Getting Started
* Install the server1, client, client1, player, and board classes in order to run it.
* First one person runs the server class and then two people connect to it by 
* one of them running the client class and the other running the client1 class
* then the server will send prompts to the clients which will be used to run the game.
* From there everything will be done automatically by the server

# Features
* Running a working battleship game on a client-server architecture where the server
* Connects to two clients and sends them information and takes in names and ship-placements
* and uses other inputs from the clients to know where to'fire' on the opponents board

# Demo
* see BattleShip Demo.mp4

# Comments
1. Have a better formatting of the Time Table
2. Be more specific about the deliverables. What are the features of the client/server? Think about what you are going to demo in the final presentation to compile a list of features to be delivered.
