Progress Update 11/5/2018

# What did your team do last week?
	* We implemented a client-server connection rather than a peer-to-peer connection, and we started working on the board class that creates a 10x10 array that will be used for the battleship game

# What will your team do this week?
	* We will continue working on implementing the game and implement user inputs for both client and server
	
# Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
	* the decision on whether to implement the game using javaFX or through the console
	
# Comments
1. Better formatting for this file to make it looks more professional (look at the ProgressUpdates.md template to see how this should look like)
2. Better organize the project repo by putting source code in a folder 
3. For the issue of p2p connection, here is a good article on how it is done: http://cs.berry.edu/~nhamid/p2p/
